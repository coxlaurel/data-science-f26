# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

# Libraries

library(googlesheets4)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1av_SXn4j0-4Rk0mQFik3LLr-uf0YdA06i3ugE6n-Zdo/edit?usp=sharing"

# Parameters
LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM    <- 299792.458 # Exact speed of light in a vacuum (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON <- 299944.00  # Michelson's speed estimate (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_PM        <- 51         # Michelson error estimate (km / s)
```

*Background*: In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to
measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the
method of Foucault\[3\], and resulted in a new estimate of
$v_0 = 299944 \pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very
close to the modern *exact* value of 2.9979246^{5}. In this challenge,
you will analyze Michelson’s original data, and explore some of the
factors associated with his experiment.

I’ve already copied Michelson’s data from his 1880 publication; the code
chunk below will load these data from a public googlesheet.

*Aside*: The speed of light is *exact* (there is **zero error** in the
value `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`) because the meter is actually
[*defined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition)
in terms of the speed of light!

### **q1** Re-create the following table (from Michelson (1880), pg. 139) using `df_michelson` and `dplyr`. Note that your values *will not* match those of Michelson *exactly*; why might this be?

| Distinctness | n   | MeanVelocity |
|--------------|-----|--------------|
| 3            | 46  | 299860       |
| 2            | 39  | 299860       |

``` r
## TODO: Compute summaries
df_q1 <- 
  df_michelson %>%
  group_by(Distinctness) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    MeanVelocity = mean(Velocity)
  )
df_q1 %>%
  arrange(desc(Distinctness)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Distinctness |   n | MeanVelocity |
|:-------------|----:|-------------:|
| 3            |  46 |     299861.7 |
| 2            |  39 |     299858.5 |
| 1            |  15 |     299808.0 |

## **Observations**:

- Write your observations here!
  - Good distinctness is the most represented distinctness in our data
    sitting at 46 total.
  - Good distinctness also has the highest mean velocity and is nearly
    50 km/s more than poor distinctness.
- Why might your table differ from Michelson’s?
  - I believe my table is different from Michelson’s because of my
    MeanVelocity type. Mine has one decimal, whereas Michelson’s is an
    integer rounded to the nearest 10.

The `Velocity` values in the dataset are the speed of light *in air*;
Michelson introduced a couple of adjustments to estimate the speed of
light in a vacuum. In total, he added $+92$ km/s to his mean estimate
for `VelocityVacuum` (from Michelson (1880), pg. 141). While the
following isn’t fully rigorous ($+92$ km/s is based on the mean
temperature), we’ll simply apply this correction to all the observations
in the dataset.

### **q2** Create a new variable `VelocityVacuum` with the $+92$ km/s adjustment to `Velocity`. Assign this new dataframe to `df_q2`.

``` r
## TODO: Adjust the data, assign to df_q2
df_q2 <-
  df_michelson %>%
  mutate(
    VelocityVacuum = Velocity + 92
  )

As part of his study, Michelson assessed the various potential sources
of error, and provided his best-guess for the error in his
speed-of-light estimate. These values are provided in
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`—his nominal estimate—and
`LIGHTSPEED_PM`—plus/minus bounds on his estimate. Put differently,
Michelson believed the true value of the speed-of-light probably lay
between `LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM` and
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM`.

Let’s introduce some terminology:\[2\]

- **Error** is the difference between a true value and an estimate of
  that value; for instance `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`.
- **Uncertainty** is an analyst’s *assessment* of the error.

Since a “true” value is often not known in practice, one generally does
not know the error. The best they can do is quantify their degree of
uncertainty. We will learn some means of quantifying uncertainty in this
class, but for many real problems uncertainty includes some amount of
human judgment.\[2\]

### **q3** Compare Michelson’s speed of light estimate against the modern speed of light value. Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

``` r
## TODO: Compare Michelson's estimate and error against the true value
MICHELSON_ERROR <- LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON
LIGHTSPEED_PM
```

    ## [1] 51

``` r
MICHELSON_ERROR
```

    ## [1] -151.542

**Observations**: - Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his
uncertainty) greater or less than the true error? - Michelson’s
uncertainty is less than the true error. - Make a quantitative
comparison between Michelson’s uncertainty and his error. - The true
error is about 3 times larger than Michelson’s uncertainty.

The following plot shows all of Michelson’s data as a [control
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart); this sort of plot
is common in manufacturing, where it is used to help determine if a
manufacturing process is under [statistical
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control).
Each dot is one of Michelson’s measurements, and the grey line connects
the mean taken for each day. The same plot also shows simulated data
using a probability model. We’ll get into statistics later in the
course; for now, let’s focus on understanding what real and simulated
data tend to look like.

### **q4** Inspect the following plot with the `Real` Michelson data and `Simulated` data from a probability model. Document the similarities and differences between the data under *observe* below.

``` r

  ) +

    data = . %>%

      summarize(velocity_mean = mean(velocity)),
    mapping = aes(y = velocity_mean),
    color = "grey50"
  ) +

    mapping = aes(y = velocity),
    size = 0.8
  ) +

  facet_grid(source~.) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Date of Measurement (1879)",

## **Observations**:

- Similarities
  - Both plots have peaks that exceed the upper error limits.
  - After Jun 16th, both plot mean velocity lines match with increase
    and decrease directions at the same dates.
  - Both plot mean velocity lines begin with an increase and plateau
    then decrease.
- Differences
  - Only real data has a trough that goes beneath the lower error
    limits.
  - The real data shows that velocity measured before Jun 16 is much
    more unreliable than velocity measured afterwards since the mean
    velocity line exceeds the adjusted for error lines.
  - The simulated data shows that velocity measured Jun 23 is more
    unreliable than data measured before since the mean velocity line
    exceeds the adjusted for error lines.
  - The simulated data overall is more consistent than the real data as
    there are fewer peaks and dips over time.
  - The simulated data holds plateaus longer than the real data, making
    the mean velocity line appear smoother.

### **q5** You have access to a few other variables. Construct a **at least three** visualizations of `VelocityVacuum` against these other factors. Are there other patterns in the data that might help explain the difference between Michelson’s estimate and `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`?

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = VelocityVacuum, x = Distinctness)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Velocity (Vacuum) vs. Distinctness")
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/plot%201-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The velocity with the most spread between the upper and lower
  quartiles is surprisingly those with the good distinctness (3). The
  distinctness with the most consistent velocities actually come from 2.
- There are a few velocity value outliers with distinctness of 1 and 2.
- Velocity values of distinctness 1 or 3 have more on the lower half of
  their respective means.

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = VelocityVacuum, x = Temp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Velocity (Vacuum) vs Temperature")
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/plot%202-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Velocity is grouped more consistently between the 60-70 degree
  temperature range. After 70 degrees, there’s clearly much more
  variation in velocity which signals that temperature was impacting
  Mendleson’s results.

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = VelocityVacuum, x = Date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Velocity (Vacuum) vs. Date")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/plot%203-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Over time, the average velocity decreased and then plateaued. Perhaps
  there was an intial learning curve, but then Mendleson got better at
  running consistent experiments. These inconsistencies would definitely
  impact his estimated speed of light.
